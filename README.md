# Final Proyect: Machine Learning
## Due date: March 6th, 2025
This is the final project for the machine learning course I'm currently taking for the specialty.

Alzheimer's Prediction Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday1/alzheimers-prediction-dataset-global

This dataset contains 74,283 records from 20 countries, providing insights into Alzheimer's disease risk factors. It includes demographic, lifestyle, medical, and genetic variables, with a biased distribution to reflect real-world disparities across regions.

This dataset is useful for predictive modeling, epidemiological studies, and healthcare research on Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

Methods:
* No Balance
* Random Under Sampler
* Random Over Sampler
* Near Miss
* SMOTE

Models:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Neural Networks
* Support Vector Machine
